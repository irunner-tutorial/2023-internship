This is what i've learned in the last 7 days:
1. I learnt somewhat how to deploy a website.
2. Also how to use docker just the basics of it.
3. I became better with problem solving because i solved some coding bat problems.
4. I learnt git and i am using my knowledge to push files to another persons repo.
